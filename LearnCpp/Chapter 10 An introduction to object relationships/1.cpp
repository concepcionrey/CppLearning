// The world of programming is filled with recurring patterns, sequences, relationships & and hierarchies. In the world of programming,
// it is possible to mimic the same governing patterns of reality into the objects & classes created. By doing so,
// we can better understand the code we write through improving reusability & making them more extensible.
// Eg. the flowers growing on a sidewalk. Although it is a plant you've never seen before, you know it is a plant because of its relatable features
// It is an instantiation of the abstraction/concept of plants.

// There are many different kind of relationships in real-life. To describe them, "relation type" words are used.
// All of these have useful analogies in C++ and can therefore, expand our understanding of C++ classes.
